# Project Overview: Personal Journaling App
## **Objective**
 - Create a mobile application and a backend service for personal journaling. Users should be able to write journal entries, categorize them, and view a summary of their entries.
## **Project Requirements**

### Mobile Application

*Platform*
 - The application will be built using React Native. You can choose to bootstrap the project using either expo or react-native-cli.
 - We prefer that the project be done using TypeScript. However, we will still accept submissions in plain **Javascript**.

#### **Features**
- User Authentication:
  1. Allow users to sign up and log in.
  2. Journal Entry Management
  3. Add new journal entries with a title, content, category, and date.
  4. Edit and delete existing entries.
- Journal View
  1. Allow users to view a list of all their journal entries.
  2. Categorization
       - Users should be able to categorize their entries e.g. Personal, Work, Travel, etc.
       - Summary View
            - Display a summary of journal entries over a selected period i.e. daily, weekly, monthly.
- Settings
  1. Allow users to update their username and password.

#### Design
Use a simple and intuitive UI, focusing on usability and clarity. You can use pre-designed UI libraries or create your own components.

### **Backend Service**
*Platform*
I will use Python backend as a backend of choice
We prefer that the project be done using TypeScript. However, we will still accept submissions in plain Javascript.

Features
1. User Management
User registration and authentication (JWT or session-based).
Profile management.
2. Journal Entry Management
CRUD operations for journal entries.
Categorization of entries.
3. Data Summary
Endpoints to fetch summary data for given periods.
4. Security
   - Ensure all endpoints are secure and accessible only by authenticated users.
5. Database
   - Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

## Project Deliverables
A GitHub repository(ies) containing the code for both the mobile app and backend service.
  - Documentation
  - Instructions on how to set up and run the backend service.
  - Instructions on how to build and run the mobile app.
  - API documentation detailing the endpoints and their usage.

#### **Timeline**
Day 1-2: Set up the project structure for both the mobile app and backend. Implement user authentication.
Day 3-4: Develop CRUD operations for journal entries and implement categorization.
Day 5: Implement the user interface and data fetching in the mobile app.
Day 6: Testing and bug fixing.
Day 7: Final touches, create documentation, and record the demo video.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code with appropriate use of design patterns.
**Functionality**: Completeness of the features as described.
**User Interface**: Usability and visual appeal of the mobile app.
**Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the setup instructions and API documentation.
